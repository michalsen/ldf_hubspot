Are you running the Hubspot Drupal contrib module and have found this error?

PHP Warning: Unknown: Input variables exceeded 1000. To increase the limit change max_input_vars in php.ini.


You have too many forms, or form fields!
What are you, crazy???

Well, this may be the fix you need.
It is an addon module to the hubspot drupal contrib that handles each form,
field by field. Add and remove mappings to your hearts content.
